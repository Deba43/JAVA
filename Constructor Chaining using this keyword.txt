Constructor Chaining using this keyword ---------

Constructor chaining is the process of calling one constructor from another constructor with respect to current object. 

One of the main use of constructor chaining is to avoid duplicate codes while having multiple constructor (by means of constructor overloading) and make code more readable.

Constructor chaining can be done in two ways: 
 

Within same class: It can be done using this() keyword for constructors in the same class
From base class: by using super() keyword to call the constructor from the base class.

The this() expression should always be the first line of the constructor.
There should be at-least be one constructor without the this() keyword (constructor 3 in above example).
Constructor chaining can be achieved in any order.

Example--------------

class Hello {
    Hello(){
        System.out.println("This is a non parameterized constructor");
    }
    Hello(int a){
        this();
        System.out.println("The value of a is " + a);
        
    }
    Hello(int i, int j)//Constructor Overloading
    {
        this(5);
        System.out.println(i+j);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new Hello(7, 8);
    }
}
